TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

It says that I'm missing libcrypto but I'm pretty sure it is installed?
  You  may need to just link your libcrypto module to libcrypto.so inside of your library directory
  On Ubuntu you should be able to just find . -iname "libcrypto*" to locate your library and link that version to the same directory but using the name libcrypto.so
